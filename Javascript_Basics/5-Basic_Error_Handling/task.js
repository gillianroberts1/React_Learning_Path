// 1. **Basic `try...catch` Task**
//    Write a function called `parseJSON` that takes a string and attempts to parse it as JSON. If it fails, catch the error and return `null`.


// 2. **Throwing Custom Errors Task**
//    Write a function called `checkAge` that takes a number representing a person's age. If the age is less than 18, throw an error with the message `"You must be at least 18 years old."`. If the age is valid, return a message saying `"Access granted"`.


// 3. **Using `finally` Task**
//    Write a function that attempts to connect to a server (simulate this with a boolean flag). If the connection is successful, return `"Connected"`. If the connection fails, throw an error. Ensure that the `finally` block always logs `"Cleaning up connection"`.
